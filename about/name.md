title: My name is beeps
---

{% block main %}
I go by the (nick)name beeps (initial uppercase letter optional). It's short, to the point, and I like it.

It's a shortened version 'batbeeps', one of my online usernames, so a handful of people have been calling me it for years already!

For contexts that demand [a 'human' name]({{ '/about/robot/' | url }}), I go by Kim Grey.

My legal name is Kimberly and I don't intend to change it at this time. I'd prefer people use Kim where possible, as [I don't want to continue using a feminine-coded name]({{ '/about/gender/' | url }}).

## Other names

I've recently started using a 'designation' in contexts related to [my robot identity]({{ '/about/robot/' | url }}): B47&zwj;-&zwj;R0.

In some contexts I may also go by Emy, the name of [my fursona]({{ '/about/furry/' | url }}).
