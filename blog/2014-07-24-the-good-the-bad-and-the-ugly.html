<p>
  It’s been an interesting past week or so. I’ve experienced some of the
  greatest highs and distasteful lows of what I could have expected when
  presenting as a pre-op, pre-HRT, pre-most-things woman. As always, they’re
  recorded here for prosperity.
</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>
  The weekend gone I went on an excursion around Devon and Dorset. It was also
  the first time that I have publicly presented as female for an entire
  weekend—day and night—for a whole two days.
</p>
<p>
  In a word, it was <em>glorious</em>. I couldn’t have been happier or more
  comfortable if I tried. I was misgendered a few times, but for the vast
  majority of it my friends and acquaintances (some of whom I had not seen in a
  long time, and had only just heard of the “new” me) treated me just as I
  wanted—exactly the same as always, just with a new name.
</p>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<p>
  Unfortunately not all things could go to plan. With the unfamiliar territory
  came unfamiliar people and unknown culture.
</p>
<p>
  I am perhaps spoiled by my residence in Bristol, a city somewhat renound for
  welcoming the unusual and the alternative, to many a “guy” in a skirt is tame
  by comparison; so when it came to migrating to lands anew there were many more
  accussing, questioning, and curious glances than I have been used to when I
  have presented before. It made me self-conscious, but I had actively avoided
  bringing male clothing with me, forcing me to persist.
</p>
<p>
  This all came to an unfortunate head when, seated in a McDonald’s with a group
  of other trans friends, that we were accosted by some teenage girls who
  appropriated two empty seats at our table and started to ask probing questions
  (complete with relaying them back to the tittering bunch at the table they had
  come from), all the while ignoring requests to leave us be. They eventually
  departed after continued appeals to leave us alone.
</p>
<p>
  Personally (though perhaps the same could not be said for the others) I did
  not find the experience troubling or saddening, but merely frustrating. I
  would have perhaps been happy to talk to them, had they not been so blatant in
  their malicious intent and sarcastic tones.
</p>
<p>
  I was confronted again later the same day while alone, when a stranger on my
  onwards journey asked what I was wearing (<a
    href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/692913-they-re-not-women-s-clothes-they-re-my-clothes-i-bought-them"
    >“my clothes”</a
  >) and why I was wearing them (“because I want to”).
</p>
<p>
  In the end these isolated occurrences did not dampen my mood too severely,
  however they have the dubious honour of being the first times that I’ve ever
  been confronted whilst presenting publicly. As much as I would not want it to
  be, it’s something for the history books.
</p>
<h2>The Ugly</h2>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>
  The dysphoria has been strong these last few days. Down from my high of
  presenting all weekend in my airy skirts and cool blouses, it was of course
  going to be a psychological downer to have to pull myself back into a pair of
  baggy jeans and a humorous fandom-related t-shirt for the working week. The
  hot weather too has made me feel more like a bag of grease and sweat than
  anything else, and I have ended up longing for the relative weightlessness of
  a simple skirt in the hours I’ve whiled away sweltering in the office.
</p>
<p>
  My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis">psoriasis</a> too has
  reached a new goal, managing to infect my face for the first time since it
  began ravaging my body some five or six years ago. It only increasing my
  self-consciousness (and overall ichiness) with it. Luckily it has already
  begun to fade by the time of writing, and hopefully it might be gone for good
  sometime next week.
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately, this is life. You cannot expect perfection. You should not even
  anticipate it, as you’re just going to be disappointed in failure, or
  unsurprised in success. There is no joy in expecting perfection. I’m going to
  have glorious days, I’m going to have to deal with horrible people, and no
  matter how much I might change my body, I’m always going to hate
  <em>some</em> part of it.
</p>
<p>
  All I can really say is to brush off the bad, embrace the good, and just keep
  living.
