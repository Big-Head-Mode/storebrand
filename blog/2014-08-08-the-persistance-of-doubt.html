title: The persistance of doubt

<p>
  One thing that differentiates me from other transgender individuals in my
  position is perhaps the sheer level of self doubt I allow myself to indulge
  in.
</p>
<p>
  I have from the very beginning doubted how I feel; explored every motive,
  analysed every moment of potentially historical significance. I have clung
  desperately to the few words of advice that have given what I am doing meaning
  and purpose—that maybe something better could become of it all, one day in the
  future.
</p>
<p>Sometimes this is comforting. Sometimes it is not.</p>
<p>
  For the uninitiated, I am not a strongly emotional person. I’m not feeling
  great, I’m feeling “okay.” I don’t find things exciting or thrilling or
  astounding, I just think they’re “alright.” I generally exercise several
  magnitudes more restraint than the average person in all manner of emotional
  behaviours; an attribute I’ve typically associated with my only fleeting bouts
  of tear-inducing dysphoria. But now these play against me.
</p>
<p>
  I have already doubted myself before even coming out. Now, weeks later, doubt
  still lingers. My life being male wasn’t <em>bad</em>, <em>per se</em>, it was
  pleasantly tolerable at the very least. I sometimes felt bad, I often felt
  wrong, but only until recently did I try and change any of that. Which just
  begs the question: Why am I trying? It may not be perfect, but it’s
  <em>tolerable</em>, and it may be a poor excuse, but I feel like I’m devaluing
  the whole sincerity of the concept just with my presence. Like I’m just a big,
  fat joke.
</p>
<p>
  I don’t really know where I’m goung with this, but that’s just the problem. I
  don’t know. I just don’t know.
