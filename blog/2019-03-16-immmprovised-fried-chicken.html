<p>
  I didn’t take a photo of it, but I improvised a fried chicken recipe today
  that might be my best one yet, so I figured I should write it down. I pretty
  much played everything by ear, so there’s not gonna be any measurements I’m
  afraid.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Get chicken fillets and make them skinny, either by cutting them up or
    flattening them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Coat both sides of each fillet in a liberal amount of salt and pepper (this
    is fried chicken after all) before dousing in lemon juice.
  </li>
  <li>
    Combine together a significant amount of plain white flour, adding in a good
    shake of paprika and cayenne pepper, a smaller shake of chilli powder, and a
    teaspoon of baking soda.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dip each fillet in the dry mixture, then egg wash, then dry mix again.
  </li>
  <li>Fry them in oil that is hot for like, four minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>It was really the taste please and thank you.</p>
