  I impulse pre-ordered the Chromecast with Google TV when it was announced a
  few weeks ago, and by the time I figured I didn’t want it anymore it was too
  late to cancel, so I have it now.
</p>

<p>My initial experience is… not great.</p>

<p>
  Set up was fine. Much the same as any previous Chromecast. A notable thing is
  when setting up it asks what streaming services you use so it can install
  those apps without you going through the Google TV app store. I didn’t select
  Disney+ because I don’t have it or intend to have it.
</p>

<p>
  After setup, I’m on the homescreen. Manage to spend about four seconds there
  before it crashes and reboots. Alright, teething problems, to be expected. I
  let it reboot.
</p>

<p>
  For some reason I have the Disney+ app. My recommendations are full of shows
  on Disney+. I do not have Disney+. I uninstall the app, still get
  recommendations for Disney+. I go into settings, untoggle the Disney+
  recommendations setting *which is still there*. Still getting recommendations
  from Disney+. Reboot. Still there. Not great.
</p>

<p>
  I peruse the apps available. No All4, no NowTV, no Apple TV+ or Apple Music.
  Granted, none of those are Google’s fault, but it doesn’t reflect well on the
  ecosystem—more than half of the services I use are just unavailable. The Emby
  app just seemed to quietly error out too, so that was useless too.
</p>

<p>
  I can’t use all of the features of the remote for whatever reason too. Volume
  buttons don’t work, during set up the system couldn’t work out how to do them
  (though I haven’t experimented since). Source switcher doesn’t work either,
  but that’s to be expected given I have an external HDMI switcher. Collectively
  makes one-third of the buttons on the remote useless, though.
</p>

<p>
  So yeah, not the best of first impressions. Seems to be fine streaming stuff,
  I guess, though nothing notably better than existing Chromecasts.
