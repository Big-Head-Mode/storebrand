  It’s been a while since the transition category got an update, for the simple
  reason that nothing has happened. When I first hopped onto that GIC waiting
  list the estimated time to getting the first appointment was 18 months. Far
  longer than it should be, but not unbearably so. On that timeline it should
  typically be about two years before hormone replacement therapy would be
  prescribed—and I was well enough past puberty that waiting would make little
  difference.

  Anyway, after <em>more than four years </em>of being on the waiting list, with
  still no word on when that first appointment may be, I’ve started hitting up a
  private doctor to see about getting HRT sorted.

  Honestly, this isn’t something that sits well with me. I wouldn’t say I abhor
  the concept of private healthcare, but I sincerely believe that healthcare
  (<em>especially </em>the kind that can drastically improve a persons quality
  of life, like trans surgeries and therapies) should not be paywalled in any
  way.

  The NHS is a wonderful institution that has been horribly treated under recent
  governments, with the gender service particularly left to rot because letting
  trans people suffer is the politically convenient option under Boris Johnson’s
  premiership. In just the last few months

  We are, horrifyingly, trending towards trans healthcare becoming impossible to
  acquire in this country, so I see little option but to try and expedite the
  process, paying out hundreds of pounds for something that in any decent
  country would be free. Joy.
