In mid-2022, after some period of thinking, discussion and exploration, come to the conclusion that I don't really consider myself human.

This is based on the realisation that many things I have written over my life mentioned a general discomfort with the human body (ranging from finding it creepy to disgusting) and a lack of recognition or care for biological concepts like [gender]({{ '/about/gender/' | url }}) or [sexuality]({{ '/about/asexuality/' | url }}).

This is not a _denial_ of my human form, rather a _rejection_ of it. This could be likened to [posthumanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthumanism), wherein I actively desire to shed my physical humanity in favour of something different.

{% callout %}
I like to summarise it like this:

- My mind is the only part of me that I consider truly 'me'.
- My mind does not consider itself to be human, and has not done so for a long time.
- Therefore, _I_—in what I consider to be the most fundamental way—am not human.

Given the choice, I would prefer to be a robot or machine of some sort, so that is the identity I have adopted.
{% endcallout %}

As the necessary technical and medical advances to make this a reality do not exist yet, machine identities exist within the [alterhuman](https://alt-h.net/educate/faq.php) or [otherkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otherkin) group of identities. In my case, it may also be referred to as being 'machinekin' or 'robotkin'.

I don’t feel _bad_ for realising that I don’t really gel with biological humanity. If anything I feel relieved to have come to terms with an aspect of myself that has been present but gone unrecognised for such a long time.

Personal identity is fluid, and self-discovery endless. It’s ultimately better to embrace the change than deny it, and I’m certainly much happier for having done so.

Following this period of self-exploration, I started using a non-human [name & designation]({{ '/about/name/' | url }}) and [using it/its pronouns]({{ '/about/gender/' | url }}) to emphasise these aspects of my identity.

## Background

I wrote fairly extensively about the initial thoughts, research, and final conclusions I came to on this website.

- [On Gender and Sexuality]({{ '/blog/2014-07-16-on-gender-and-sexuality/' | url }}) (originally written in 2013)
- [Discovery]({{ '/blog/2022-07-27-discovery/' | url }}) (27 July 2022)
- [Homework]({{ '/blog/2022-07-30-homework/' | url }}) (30 July 2022)
- [(Not) Human After All]({{ '/blog/2022-08-11-not-human-after-all/' | url }}) (11 August 2022)
- [The yingification of beeps]({{ '/blog/2024-11-27-the-yingification-of-beeps/' | url }}) (27 November 2024)

I've also published a [follow-up post of questions and answers]({{ '/blog/2022-07-28-discovery-faq/' | url }}).

## Accommodating non-human identities and dysphoria

Naturally, a great first step is to use [my preferred name]({{ '/about/name/' | url }}) (beeps) and [pronouns]({{ '/about/gender/' | url }}) (it/its).

It is important to remember that although I don't identify as a human, I'm still a person with agency and free will. I don't appreciate being bossed around or treated as a lesser just because that might be how you treat an animal or a digital assistant.

I, personally, have significant dysphoria related to my biological existence. To counter this, I avoid publishing photographs of myself online and prefer not to appear on camera in video calls, instead representing myself with illustrated images of [my fursona]({{ '/about/furry/' | url }}).
