title: I'm a frontend developer

I currently work for the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) (GDS) on the [GOV.UK Design System](http://design-system.service.gov.uk/). I'm not currently looking for a new role, please stop asking.

I've been making websites professionally since 2012 and as a hobby since 2003. Yes, I've been at this for [over 20 years]({{ '/blog/2023-07-25-20-years/' | url }}).

In that time I've picked up a lot of skills in a lot of frontend, backend and dev-ops-y areas, but since 2015 I've gravitated towards almost solely doing [front-of-the-frontend](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/) style work.

I like delving into things like the semantic web and the nitty-gritty bits of HTML that everyone thinks they know but don't always get right.

I like pushing for accessibility, inclusivity and making information available, usable, and _pleasant_ for as many people as possible, without limitation.

I like constructing design systems and doing the hard work to make things easier for others.

Mostly, I just like making things that are pretty and functional.

## Being a civil servant

Working for GDS means that I'm a civil servant and I'm bound by the Civil Service Code to maintain a level of political objectivity in spaces that the general public may see and interpret them as political bias, even when that place exists outside of work‚Äîsay, a personal website like this one.

As a consequence, it is rare that I'll comment on political matters in public spaces, such as on this website or [my social media profiles]({{ '/contact/' | url }}).

I make a few exceptions to this. Work-related disputes and union membership can be freely discussed. I also personally do not consider discussion of LGBTQIA+ topics to be 'political speech', that is a discussion of my life and my experiences.

Just because some parliamentarians choose to politicise the rights and struggles of a minority to stoke unnecessary culture wars does not mean those things are _actually_ political in nature. Trans rights are human rights. That is not up for debate. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è

There are likely plenty of things floating around from before I joined the Civil Service that do not align with the Code, which I believe are allowed to remain as they are, as the Code does not apply retroactively.
