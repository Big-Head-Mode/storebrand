      <h2 class="kimHeading-l">Overview</h2>
      <p class="kimBody">Ash is a former human who was infected by and transformed into an amphimorpho, a genetically engineered chimeric species created through combining the DNA of various Terran species with alien genetic material.</p>
      <p class="kimBody">Amphimorpho are very large, relatively light creatures. In this form, Ash is around 3 metres long from snout to tail tip (1.75 metres of which is just the tail) and weighs around 115 kilograms.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="kimGrid_column kimGrid_column-full defiant:kimGrid_column-oneHalf" id="abilities">
      <h2 class="kimHeading-l">Abilities</h2>
      <p class="kimBody">As an amphimorpho, Ash has enhanced senses and is capable of shapeshifting and accelerated healing.</p>
      <p class="kimBody">Although she can manipulate her density when shapeshifting, Ash cannot become dramatically larger or smaller than normal. Both shifting and maintaining a shifted form requires energy and concentration. Unless she has imprinted DNA from a biological being, she can only reproduce the outside appearance of something. </p>
      <p class="kimBody">As a <a class="kimLink" href="https://amphimorpho.carrd.co/#secretpage">mutant amphimorpho</a>, Ash is a carrier of the amphimorpho virus and can transmit it to others.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="kimGrid_column kimGrid_column-full defiant:kimGrid_column-oneHalf" id="forms">
      <h2 class="kimHeading-l">Alternate forms</h2>
      <p class="kimBody">Ash's basal form can change in size, proportions, have four or six limbs (two or four &ldquo;arms&rdquo;) and have a stomach pouch. She can freely adapt to walking on two, four, or six legs.</p>
      <p class="kimBody">Ash can change the physical composition of her form, for example, to become a pooltoy or plush toy. She is able to alter her fur pattern and colours at will.</p>
      <p class="kimBody">Outside of her basal form, Ash will normally shapeshift to appear as a human, bat, or domestic cat.</p>

        <h2 class="kimHeading-l">Common mistakes</h2>
        
        <h3 class="kimHeading-m">Facial features</h3>
        <p class="kimBody"><strong>Amphimorpho have snouts but no nostrils.</strong> Their sense of smell is more similar to that of a snake, with olfactory sensors in the roof of the mouth, and their tongues assist in smelling.</p>
        <p class="kimBody">Also quite similar to snakes, <strong>amphimorpho tongues are forked at the end</strong>. They have <strong>prominent upper and lower canine teeth</strong>, though these are usually only visible when the mouth is open.</p>
      
        <h3 class="kimHeading-m">Skin and blush colour</h3>
        <p class="kimBody">The visibly green parts of Ash's body are bioluminescent and <strong>glow softly</strong> in darkness.</p>
        <p class="kimBody">Similarly, <strong>Ash blushes green</strong>. Don't ask exactly how, as she doesn't have a circulatory system in the first place.</p>
      
        <h3 class="kimHeading-m">Paws</h3>
        <p class="kimBody"><strong>Ash's paws have four toes.</strong> Typically, these work as a single unit (e.g., when walking); however, one of these toes can operate as an opposable thumb for gripping objects.</p>
      
        <h3 class="kimHeading-m">Downstairs parts</h3>
        <p class="kimBody">Amphimorpho are <strong>biologically genderless</strong> and do not have sexual organs.</p>
        <p class="kimBody">Ash doesn't have a digestive system in any traditional sense. Therefore, she doesn't have a need for a butt or buttocks and should not be portrayed with them.</p>
      
        <h3 class="kimHeading-m">Ash is not magical</h3>
        <p class="kimBody"><strong>Ash is not magical.</strong> She cannot do spells, float, or fly. I have no idea where people got this idea, but it's come up more than once.</p>
