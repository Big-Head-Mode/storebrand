  description: A list of common mistakes and oversights made when drawing Ash.
---

Amphimorpho are... not a particularly well known fursona species. Naturally, some people have made mistakes or incorrect assumptions when drawing Ash in the past.

In lieu of making you read [the extensive reference guide for the species](https://amphimorpho.carrd.co/), I figured I should collect those common mistakes here.

## Appearance

### Facial features

**Amphimorpho have snouts but no nostrils.** Their sense of smell is more similar to that of a snake, with olfactory sensors in the roof of the mouth, and their tongues assist in smelling.

Also quite similar to snakes, **amphimorpho tongues are slightly forked at the end**.

They have **prominent upper and lower canine teeth**, though these are usually only visible when the mouth is open.

**Ash's eyes have green irises** post-mutation, in both amphimorpho and human forms. Prior to mutation they are brown.

### Hair

**Ash's hair is 'dyed' green at the tips.** This is true regardless of what form she appears in. If depicting Ash pre-mutation, the tips are still coloured green, but the shade is much more muted.

Typically, **Ash's hair covers one eye**. This is normally the one furthest from the 'viewer'. This is really just a stylistic choice that I like, but it's not a requirement.

### Skin and blush colour

The visibly green parts of Ash's body are bioluminescent and **glow softly in darkness**.

Similarly, **Ash blushes green**. Don't ask exactly how, given she doesn't have a circulatory system in the first place.

**Amphimorpho 'flesh' is very soft and malleable**, having texture and characteristics similar to memory foam.

### Legs and paws

**Ash's paws have four toes.** Typically, these work as a single unit (e.g., when walking); however, the outer two of these toes can operate as an opposable thumb for gripping objects.

When depicted with six legs, the **middle pair of legs should be positioned closer to the forelegs**.

### Tail

**Ash's tail is _very_ long**, it is longer than her torso and makes up about 60% of her total body length.

**The end of Ash's tail is 'goopy' and semi-fluid.** It is affected by forces such as gravity and momentum. Globs of it can become detached in response to movement.

### Downstairs parts

Amphimorpho are **biologically genderless** and do not have sexual organs.

Ash doesn't have a digestive system in any traditional sense and, in her basal form, will typically sit or lay down on her front. As such, she **doesn't have buttocks** in amphimorpho form.

## Shapeshifted forms

Ash can really look like anything when shapeshifted, but I like the idea that **her irises remain luminescent green** regardless of what form she takes (assuming the form has any eyes, anyway...)

**When depicted as a plushie**, Ash has a label attached to her tail with the silhouette of a bat on it.

**When depicted as a pooltoy**, Ash usually has handles attached to her back. (Valve location is TBD. Make it up if you want.)

## Abilities

**Ash is not magical.** She cannot do spells, float, or fly (at least, not without shapeshifting wings). I have no idea where people got this idea, but it's come up more than once.
