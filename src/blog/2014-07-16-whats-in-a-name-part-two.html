<p>
  Further to
  <a href="/2014/07/12/whats-in-a-name/">my previous post</a> regarding how I
  found my new given name, I’ve been spending the time since then trying to
  choose a new surname to complement it.
</p>
<p>
  My name, for all intents and purposes within the fairly specific circle in
  which this currently applies, is now <strong>Kim Nightingale</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Just as before when I sought inspiration from history, this time I dove into
  the worlds of science, politics, philosophy, and ornithology. Similarly the
  same rules applied: it had to be interesting and something I could immediately
  associate with; it also had to sound good alongisde “Kim,” which was a task
  easier said than said in a way that sounds good.
</p>
<p>
  Almost immediately I landed on Darwin.
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, the
  author of <em>The Origin of Species</em>; the basis of current evolutionary
  theory. I’m undergoing a personal evolution in one sense. Meaningful? Check.
  But “Kim Darwin”? No, that doesn’t sound right at all. I moved on.
</p>
<p>
  For the longest time I lingered on “Kim Newton,” for the discoverer of gravity
  Sir <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issac_Newton">Issac Newton</a>. It
  didn’t have any particular relevance outside of being a well-known British
  scientist, but the name sounded good so I stuck with it through much of the
  selection process.
</p>
<p>
  One of the immediate problems I came across was the diversity of names that
  existed in academia. Although that provided such a wide pool to choose from,
  it quickly became clear that names such as
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Einstein</a>,
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler">Kepler</a>,
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei">Galilei</a>, and
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi">Fermi</a> weren’t going to
  be a good match; either from being so distinctly foreign by comparison, or
  otherwise being so heavily associated with their originators that detaching
  them would have been a lifelong uphill struggle. I thus (following a
  suggestion to use “Kissinger”, which I rejected for the association to
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a>)
  deviated to one of my other topics of interest—politics.
</p>
<p>
  Not wanting the association and political imprints of those of recent memory,
  I aimed instead at historical figures and political philosophers that I shared
  ideals with. I briefly considered Marx, Hobbes, and Keynes (after
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx">Karl Marx</a>,
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a>, and
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes"
    >John Maynard Keynes</a
  >). I idled for a moment over Dewey (from the philosopher
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey">John Dewey</a>, as well as
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvil_Dewey">Melvil Dewey</a>—the
  inventor of the Dewey Decimal System). I even managed to get in
  <a href="https://twitter.com/kimpegasus/status/489513698252173312"
    >a <em>hilarious</em> pun</a
  >
  about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>.
</p>
<p>
  And yet despite all my intentions, once again the ultimate inspiration for the
  name was not the halls of history or science or philosophy. It was
  <a href="https://twitter.com/megaRammy/status/489504866176618496">a tweet</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Nightingale. Kim Nightingale. It sounds good. I could retroactively apply it
  to
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale"
    >Florence Nightingale</a
  >; social reformer, writer, philanthropist, and the inventor of the polar area
  diagram. Politics, literature, charity, design—it was a perfect inspiration.
  It’s even relevant to birds!
</p>
<p>
  I must admit, I’m not totally sold on the name just yet, but I’m giving it a
  bit of time to settle in. I might come to love it.
</p>
<p>
  So here I am. Say hello to—at least for the time being—Miss Kim Nightingale.
</p>
