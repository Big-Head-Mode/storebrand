  description: Trying to come up with an inspired surname.

Further to [my previous post](/2014/07/12/whats-in-a-name/) regarding how I found my new given name, I’ve been spending the time since then trying to choose a new surname to complement it.

My name, for all intents and purposes within the fairly specific circle in which this currently applies, is now **Kim Nightingale**.

Just as before when I sought inspiration from history, this time I dove into the worlds of science, politics, philosophy, and ornithology. Similarly the same rules applied: it had to be interesting and something I could immediately associate with; it also had to sound good alongisde “Kim,” which was a task easier said than said in a way that sounds good.

Almost immediately I landed on Darwin. [Charles Darwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin), the author of _The Origin of Species_; the basis of current evolutionary theory. I’m undergoing a personal evolution in one sense. Meaningful? Check. But “Kim Darwin”? No, that doesn’t sound right at all. I moved on.

For the longest time I lingered on “Kim Newton,” for the discoverer of gravity Sir [Issac Newton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issac_Newton). It didn’t have any particular relevance outside of being a well-known British scientist, but the name sounded good so I stuck with it through much of the selection process.

One of the immediate problems I came across was the diversity of names that existed in academia. Although that provided such a wide pool to choose from, it quickly became clear that names such as [Einstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein), [Kepler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler), [Galilei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei), and [Fermi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi) weren’t going to be a good match; either from being so distinctly foreign by comparison, or otherwise being so heavily associated with their originators that detaching them would have been a lifelong uphill struggle. I thus (following a suggestion to use “Kissinger”, which I rejected for the association to [Henry Kissinger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger)) deviated to one of my other topics of interest—politics.

Not wanting the association and political imprints of those of recent memory, I aimed instead at historical figures and political philosophers that I shared ideals with. I briefly considered Marx, Hobbes, and Keynes (after [Karl Marx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx), [Thomas Hobbes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes), and [John Maynard Keynes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes)). I idled for a moment over Dewey (from the philosopher [John Dewey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey), as well as [Melvil Dewey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvil_Dewey)—the inventor of the Dewey Decimal System). I even managed to get in [a _hilarious_ pun](https://twitter.com/kimpegasus/status/489513698252173312) about [Immanuel Kant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant).

And yet despite all my intentions, once again the ultimate inspiration for the name was not the halls of history or science or philosophy. It was [a tweet](https://twitter.com/megaRammy/status/489504866176618496).

Nightingale. Kim Nightingale. It sounds good. I could retroactively apply it to [Florence Nightingale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale); social reformer, writer, philanthropist, and the inventor of the polar area diagram. Politics, literature, charity, design—it was a perfect inspiration. It’s even relevant to birds!

I must admit, I’m not totally sold on the name just yet, but I’m giving it a bit of time to settle in. I might come to love it.

So here I am. Say hello to—at least for the time being—Miss Kim Nightingale.
