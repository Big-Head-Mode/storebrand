Yesterday I was feeling a bit rubbish about trans things. Having my friends being so far ahead in the whole process is kind of frustrating and jealousy inducing at times. I didn’t speak up about it, and although a temporary frustration it’s another little niggle that I let get to me more than I should have.

Today has been better. I went on a shopping trip with my friend who really pushed me to try things (something I really need, given how timid and easily embarrassed I am alone) and I came out of it with some nice new clothes and a teensy bit more progress with replacing my wardrobe and getting more used to the impracticalities (but ridiculous comfort) of women’s clothing.

Hopefully there’s more todays to come.
