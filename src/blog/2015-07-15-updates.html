<p>There… really aren’t any.</p>
<p>
  Absolutely no notable progress has been made on the transition front over the
  last few months. I’ve not even bought any new clothes, despite some of my
  older (male) ones being ravaged by moths.
</p>
<p>
  I’m starting to really suspect that my GIC referral was never actually made,
  having now gone some 13 months without hearing anything at all. That’s kind of
  saddening, but I’m kind of hesitant to call out my GP on failing to do what I
  asked of them.
</p>
<p>
  On the plus side Bristol Pride happened the weekend just gone, and as always
  it was quite fun to dress in my neat little skirt and hang around without
  worry of being confronted for it. It’s really makes such an big difference to
  my self confidence knowing that.
</p>
<p>
  Also I got my greedy mitts on a trans flag wristband to complement the rainbow
  one I got last year. Just a little something to remember myself by.
</p>
<p>I guess for now I’ll just be plodding along.</p>
