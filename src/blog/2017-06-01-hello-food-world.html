<p>
  Hi, I’m Kimberly. I build websites and try to make the world a nicer place,
  and now I’m&nbsp;learning to cook.
</p>

<p>
  How I managed&nbsp;to spend my life thus far (a quarter of a century!) only
  really knowing&nbsp;basic recipes might be a mystery to a lot of you. Putting
  it like that&nbsp;it sounds like a mystery to me too, but it’s true. I’ve
  lived a lot of my life making the most basic preparations of some basic
  ingredients resulting in some very basic outcomes. I couldn’t tell you the
  difference between a skillet and a frying pan, when to use a metal or silicon
  spatula, or what the heck the difference is between table salt and sea salt
  other than one of them is apparently from the sea.
</p>

<p>
  But no more! I’m trying to expand my repertoire and, heck, I need a new hobby,
  so I’m trying to expand my knowledge and my tastebuds, and given I’m a web
  developer I figured I should blog about it too. ‘Cause that might just keep me
  motivated too.
</p>

<p>
  So hello and welcome to&nbsp;<em><strong>Kim Does Food</strong></em
  >, where Kim will shortly be doing food.
