Hi, I’m Kimberly. I build websites and try to make the world a nicer place, and now I’m learning to cook.

How I managed to spend my life thus far (a quarter of a century!) only really knowing basic recipes might be a mystery to a lot of you. Putting it like that it sounds like a mystery to me too, but it’s true. I’ve lived a lot of my life making the most basic preparations of some basic ingredients resulting in some very basic outcomes. I couldn’t tell you the difference between a skillet and a frying pan, when to use a metal or silicon spatula, or what the heck the difference is between table salt and sea salt other than one of them is apparently from the sea.

But no more! I’m trying to expand my repertoire and, heck, I need a new hobby, so I’m trying to expand my knowledge and my tastebuds, and given I’m a web developer I figured I should blog about it too. ‘Cause that might just keep me motivated too.

So hello and welcome to **_Kim Does Food_**, where Kim will shortly be doing food.
