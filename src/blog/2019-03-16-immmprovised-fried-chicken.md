I didn’t take a photo of it, but I improvised a fried chicken recipe today that might be my best one yet, so I figured I should write it down. I pretty much played everything by ear, so there’s not gonna be any measurements I’m afraid.

1.  Get chicken fillets and make them skinny, either by cutting them up or flattening them.
2.  Coat both sides of each fillet in a liberal amount of salt and pepper (this is fried chicken after all) before dousing in lemon juice.
3.  Combine together a significant amount of plain white flour, adding in a good shake of paprika and cayenne pepper, a smaller shake of chilli powder, and a teaspoon of baking soda.
4.  Dip each fillet in the dry mixture, then egg wash, then dry mix again.
5.  Fry them in oil that is hot for like, four minutes.

It was really the taste please and thank you.
