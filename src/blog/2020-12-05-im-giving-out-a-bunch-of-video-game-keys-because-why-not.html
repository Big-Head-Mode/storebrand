<p>
  Those who know me will know I’m not much of a gamer. I almost entirely solely
  play management and simulator games (with a particular favourite being
  modded-to-the-teeth Cities: Skylines). Most games just don’t interest me, nor
  am I competent enough at runny-drivey-shooty-type games to really enjoy them.
</p>

<p>
  As a result—be it from purchasing a random Humble Bundle because the entire
  bundle is still somehow cheaper than just the single game I want in it, or
  just having games land in my lap somehow—I end up owning keys for games I
  never, ever intend to actually play, or otherwise have already bought.

  Well, in the spirit of the holidays, I might as well put those years of keys
  to use. If you’re a friend of mine on

  of these can be yours for free; first come, first served; zero strings
  attached. My only request is that you only take the games you actually intend
  to play, don’t be a hoarder!

  (Disclaimer that some of these keys have been sitting unclaimed for many, many
  years. Some might well have expired in that time, I have no idea. The Origin
  ones at least all still seem to be valid.)
