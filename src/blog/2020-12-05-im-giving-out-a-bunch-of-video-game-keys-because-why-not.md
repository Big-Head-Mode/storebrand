Those who know me will know I’m not much of a gamer. I almost entirely solely play management and simulator games (with a particular favourite being modded-to-the-teeth Cities: Skylines). Most games just don’t interest me, nor am I competent enough at runny-drivey-shooty-type games to really enjoy them.

As a result—be it from purchasing a random Humble Bundle because the entire bundle is still somehow cheaper than just the single game I want in it, or just having games land in my lap somehow—I end up owning keys for games I never, ever intend to actually play, or otherwise have already bought.

Well, in the spirit of the holidays, I might as well put those years of keys to use. If you’re a friend of mine on [Mastodon](https://awoo.space/@kimpegasus), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kimpegasus), or anywhere else I’ve probably just posted this link, gimmie a poke and any of these can be yours for free; first come, first served; zero strings attached. My only request is that you only take the games you actually intend to play, don’t be a hoarder!

(Disclaimer that some of these keys have been sitting unclaimed for many, many years. Some might well have expired in that time, I have no idea. The Origin ones at least all still seem to be valid.)
