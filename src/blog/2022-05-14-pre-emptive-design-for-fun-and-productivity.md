A lot of famous individuals are well known for [always wearing the same clothes](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/09/world/gallery/decision-fatigue-same-clothes/index.html). Usually they credit this to reducing 'decision fatigue'â€”by not having to choose how to dress every day, it leaves more time to mull over the bigger decisions they have to make.

I don't wear _exactly_ the same clothes every day (though it's rare you'll find me wearing something other than jeans and a graphic tee), but when it comes to random side projects I do have a habit of thinking more about how it looks than how it works.

To remedy this, I've made '[my brand](/brand)'.

{% responsiveImage "./src/images/my-brand.gif", "An animated GIF of Commander Shepard from the Mass Effect video games, lifting his arms into the air and shouting 'My brand!'" %}

"My brand" is a loose collection of fonts and colours that are ready made for those odd-random-side-projects I occassionally bust out in a couple of hours or days.

If you often find yourself struck with decision fatigue or a frequent focus on form over function, I suggest giving it a try. Whip up a quick style guide, don't worry about it being perfect and make sure it's not too restrictive, and then just run with it for a bit.

There's no reason it can't evolve or be iterated upon as requirements demand, but you may just find dressing all your quick, little projects in the same clothes to be a real time saver.
