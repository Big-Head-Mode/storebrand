With Musk giving Twitter one of [the most short-sighted, poorly thought-through rebrands](https://mastodon.online/@davidaugust/110771397721359205) in tech industry history, a good number of folks areâ€”once againâ€”exodusing from the service.

The problem is many of them don't know where to go, so here's an easy reference comparing all of the hip and happening Twitter alternatives.

{% character variant="innards" %}
This is meant to be a teensy bit tongue-in-cheek. I have a preference and I'm not shying away from that, but as of writing, the basic data is pretty much accurate.
{% endcharacter %}

## Who's in charge?

**X-Twitter:** Certified asshat Elon Musk.

**Bluesky Social:** Jay Graber, who apparently invented a cryptocurrency. Certified asshat Jack Dorsey is the founder and on the board of directors; certified asshat Elon Musk is an investor.

**Meta Threads:** Certified asshat Mark Zuckerberg.

**Mastodon:** If you're friends with a furry who works in the tech industry, probably them.

## How easy is it to register?

**X-Twitter:** Open to basically everyone, not that you want to be there.

**Bluesky Social:** Invite only with a waiting list currently weeks or months long. Guess you're not talking to your friends any time soon. ðŸ¤·

**Meta Threads:** Not available in half the world because [they already know the app breaches privacy laws](https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/07/06/why-has-threads-metas-answer-to-twitter-not-launched-in-the-eu). Intrinsically tied to having an Instagram account.

**Mastodon:** Depends, but it's only about as complicated as [picking which email provider you use](https://xeiaso.net/blog/idk-about-email).

## How's the moderation?

**X-Twitter:** Mostly non-existent. Musk fired everyone involved in moderation.

**Bluesky Social:** Mostly non-existent. Bluesky expects users to moderate one another, apparently. It's not going great.

**Meta Threads:** You'll probably get banned for saying a swear.

**Mastodon:** As thorough as you want it to be. Smaller instances (fewer than a couple thousand users) tend to do it best.

## How are the rules?

**X-Twitter:** Absolutely godawful.

**Bluesky Social:** A little bit chaotic because of the whole "users moderate each other" thing. [Hateful slurs are apparently fine](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/pull/1319) but tasteful nudity isn't? Needs work.

**Meta Threads:** You _will_ get banned for saying a swear.

**Mastodon:** As loose or as authoritarian as you want it to be. If you don't like them, you can just use a different instance.

## Does it respect my privacy and data rights?

**X-Twitter:** Wait, why do you automatically download my search history again?

**Bluesky Social:** Asks for a few bits here and there, but generally fine.

**Meta Threads:** Requires you to use your legal name. Would own your first-born child if it could.

**Mastodon:** Asks for literally nothing. Your data is your own.

## Does it have user ran instances?

**X-Twitter:** Of course not, how is Elon supposed to make money like that?!

**Bluesky Social:** Coming eventually... supposedly. They just haven't gotten around to writing that part of the protocol and have no idea how it'll actually work yet. Bit of a weird flex for an already live service.

**Meta Threads:** Haha no.

**Mastodon:** Yes, thousands of them based around every conceivable and niche interest.

## Does it work with the open web?

**X-Twitter:** Actively hostile to the open web.

**Bluesky Social:** Actively hostile to the open web. Is making their own proprietary version of the ActivityPub specification for no obvious reason other than to be dicks about it.

**Meta Threads:** Haha no.

**Mastodon:** Open source. Built on many open technologies, primarily the W3C's [ActivityPub specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/), developed cooperatively by [several individuals without corporate involvement](https://octodon.social/@cwebber/110668011757667052). Cross-compatible with dozens of other services. Has multiple forks to introduce new features in a decentralised ecosystem outside of any one person's control.

## How many posts can I read in a day?

**X-Twitter:** 600, unless you give Elon your lunch money.

**Bluesky Social:** Unlimited.

**Meta Threads:** Currently unlimited, but have said [they will introduce read limits in future](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/17/threads-limits-twitter/).

**Mastodon:** Unlimited. Why the heck would you put read limits on a service based on reading lots of shortform posts what the fâ€”?!

## How many characters can I post?

**X-Twitter:** 280, unless you're Chinese, Japanese or Korean, in which case it's 140, unless you give Elon your lunch money, in which case it's 25,000.

**Bluesky Social:** 300, for some reason.

**Meta Threads:** You know, a normal amount.

**Mastodon:** Defaults to 500, but many instances set it higher and don't force you to pay for the privilege.

## Are there algorithms to decide what I should see?

**X-Twitter:** Yes, and what you should see is Elon Musk's posts. Also ads.

**Bluesky Social:** Yes but apparently it's fine because you'll be able to "customise" them, whatever that means.

**Meta Threads:** It's the people who make Facebook, of course there is. It'll be destroying democracy before the decade is out.

**Mastodon:** No. Thank god.

## Are there third-party apps?

**X-Twitter:** Not anymore!

**Bluesky Social:** Not a one.

**Meta Threads:** Haha no.

**Mastodon:** Yes, dozens of them. People have made Mastodon clients for [Mac System 7](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/02/03/even-your-antique-mac-can-use-mastodon) and [T9 dumbphones](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mastodon/comments/10fvalz/working_on_a_mastodon_client_on_kaios_phones/). Mastodon is where most of the Twitter ecosystem developers went to after Musk murdered their children, so the quality is often exceptional.

## Is there an API I can use?

**X-Twitter:** Only if you're a fan of paying extortionate fees to do anything useful.

**Bluesky Social:** Maybe? Kinda? It seems like there are dozens of API libraries and yet little actual API documentation.

**Meta Threads:** Haha no.

**Mastodon:** Yes, and it's so easy to use. I've written [so many integrations]({{ '/blog/2023-02-07-building-a-bat-bot/' | url }}) with Mastodon already. You don't even need to have registered an account to use it.

## How sustainable is it?

**X-Twitter:** Probably won't survive another year at this rate.

**Bluesky Social:** Has promise, but distrust of the leadership, incomplete protocol and restricted adoption makes it liable to fail.

**Meta Threads:** It'll be around for as long as Zuck thinks he can make money out of it. After that, it'll die.

**Mastodon:** Mastodon will probably live forever. This is not an exaggeration. I am not joking. It's basically the IRC of social media microblogging.

## Anything else?

**X-Twitter:** The best time to leave was _before_ Musk cut off all the cross-posters and migration tools. The second best time to leave is right now.

**Bluesky Social:** If they actually cared about decentralised social networking they would have just contributed to ActivityPub development. They were approached. They said no. They're probably never going to actually do it.

**Meta Threads:** Doesn't support alt text for images. Big fail. Also seriously, why does the app need access to my search history and medical information?

**Mastodon:** One of the co-authors of the ActivityPub specification nicknamed it the [Trans Furry Network Protocol](https://octodon.social/@cwebber/109270373733383763). That's a ringing endorsement if ever there was any.
