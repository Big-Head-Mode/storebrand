Yeah, I'm going off about Bluesky, [again]({{ '/blog/2024-09-18-the-bluesky-haters-guide-to-using-bluesky/' | url }}).

Having spent some time on Cohost, the [sadly departed social networking site]({{ '/blog/2024-09-12-in-memory-of-cohost/' | url }}) that purposefully didn't display engagement statistics for anything and finding that _much healthier_ for my state of mind, I had ended up making a user style for Bluesky that did the same thing.

If you're not sure how to use a user style, check out [my blog post on user stylesheets from 2023]({{ '/blog/2023-04-26-using-userstyles-in-2023/' | url }}).

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```css
/** 
 * User style to hide various numbers on Bluesky's interface.
 * Because social networks are meant to be social, not about popularity.
 * Made by beeps: https://beeps.website/
 */

/* Hide likes and share counts on feeds. */
[data-testid="likeCount"],
[data-testid="repostCount"] {
  display: none !important;
}

/* Hide likes and share counts on individual posts. */
[data-testid="likeCount-expanded"],
[data-testid="repostCount-expanded"] {
  display: none !important;
}

/* Hide the reply count on feeds. */
[data-testid="replyBtn"] div {
  display: none !important;
}

/* Hide the follower and following links on profiles. */
[data-testid="profileHeaderFollowersButton"],
[data-testid="profileHeaderFollowsButton"] {
  display: none !important;
}

/* ALTERNATIVELY: To hide just the numbers and not the entire links, comment
 * out the above block and uncomment this one. */
/* [data-testid="profileHeaderFollowersButton"] span:first-child,
[data-testid="profileHeaderFollowsButton"] span:first-child {
  display: none !important;
} */
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

This code is provided as-is and is unlikely to receive future updates.

Personally, I've stopped using Bluesky entirely. If you still want to see my online rambles over there, follow [the bridged fediverse account](https://bsky.app/profile/beeps.social.beeps.gay.ap.brid.gy) instead.
