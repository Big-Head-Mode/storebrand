{% callout %}
Someone decided to waste taxpayer money complaining about this post. You can probably find an unredacted version of it on your web archive service of choice.
{% endcallout %}

{% redaction 201 %}.

At least as best I can remember it.

Hi, I'm beeps. I'm agender and use it/its pronouns.

After a 10 year wait I finally started HRT in December. It shouldn't have taken that long.

I've had a few days now to ponder how I feel about this whole thing, and I've written it on a placard here. For those who can't see it, it says <q>What awful world has been made that living genuinely is a radical act.</q>

How awful it is that we fight merely for the right to exist as ourselves.

What awful people see those who are already oppressed, who want nothing but the right to exist, and decide to punch down.

Do you think that as they lay down for the night, the embers of their vitriol subsiding, that they consider the thought <q>Am I the baddie?</q>

{% redaction 130 %}

Do they ever think of the blood they have on their hands?

Does thinking that they think about it give them too much credit?

This {% redaction 6 %} sets a dangerous precedent not just for trans men and women.

It erases intersex people and non-binary people.

It erodes the rights of lesbian women who date trans women, and gay men who date trans men.

It erodes the freedoms of cis women who look a little too 'butch' and cis men who look a little too 'fey'.

How far we have fallen when less than 10 years ago we had a {% redaction 27 %} that had our backs.

What an awful world has been made that living genuinely is now a radical act.

**Keep living genuinely.**
