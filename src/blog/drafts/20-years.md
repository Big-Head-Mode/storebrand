Continuing this month's apparent theme of being late, I totally neglected to remember a rather significant anniversary that came and went earlier this year.

Some time back in 2003, on April the 25th, whilst kinda bored during a visit to my aunt's house in Cardiff, I made my first website.

This year is my twentieth year as a website developer.
