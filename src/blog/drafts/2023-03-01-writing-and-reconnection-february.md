In a word: oof.

February, perhaps congruently with it being the shortest month, has been a sinkhole for productivity. I spent nearly half of the month bogged down with the flu, and even after recovering from it I mainly just wanted to catch up on the 'relaxation' part of the prescribed 'rest and relaxation'.

It turns out that feeling like a waddling bag of mucus 24 hours a day is not particularly relaxing.

Also new series of _Aggretsuko_, _Battlebots_ and _Drive to Survive_ dropped on Netflix and, c'mon, [I'm only non-human]({{ '/about/robot/' | url }}).
