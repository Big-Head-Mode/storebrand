I am not normal.

I make no secret of that fact. I've a convoluted self-identity, I partake in unusual hobbies, I'm almost certainly neurodivergent in a way I've never seen benefit in having diagnosed.

I am weird, and I'm alright with that.

It doesn't really affect anything I do, either. Pretty much everyone on an individual level is fine with my little weirdsies, yet one area of life where there's a near constant struggle is work.

The work environment, at least in desk-based jobs, seems to insist on communication skills above all other skill. It insists that success be put into quantifiable numbers. It insists that upward mobility comes with responsibility over a greater number of people.

And I, with my little weirdsies, do not gel with this at all.

I don't like appearing on camera or presenting before an audience. They trigger my dysphoria and anxiety.

I don't like making small talk. I

I don't like selling myself. A braggart I am not.

I don't like critiquing other people. Maybe I'm too forgiving, maybe I'm too conscious of feelings, maybe I trust others to always be trying their best; but it's really hard for me to find flaws in others, and I despise having to tell them that something isn't good enough.

I don't like working from an office. I find the lack of control over my environment uncomfortable and the presence of other people distracting.

I don't like managing people. I don't want to be in charge of others, I don't consider being in charge of others a quantifier for success. I'd rather be scrabbling around with code than directing others on how to do the same thing. I'm a maker, not a manager.
