[Kyresti on Cohost](https://cohost.org/Kyresti) asked:

> Say you're coming across someone (like me), who knew how to make a website with HTML 4.0 when 4.0 was still new, Angelfire, and nothing else. Later brushed on some basic concepts like FTP, servers and hosting, and the existence of CSS and javascript (albeit having not learned or practiced either). Talking table-sorcery, bright garish colors, midi music and visitor counters. The origin of what a lot of neocities culture tries to revisit.

[J. Henry Waugh on the fediverse](https://chaos.social/@jhwgh1968) asked:

> "Frameworkless" Web 2.0

> Think static site, but with small dynamic affordances. E.g. instead of a Web 1.0 form submission, show a spinner until the POST is done then print "Sent!"
>
> How to do that in modern browsers (e.g. Promises) is something everyone has their own way to do
>
> [...]

> The reason everyone builds frameworks for everything is partly features, but also seems that if you want to do it in a way that's compatible with all browsers (although that seems to be falling off, alas...) you have to write a bunch of polyfills and boilerplate

> jQuery is the least bad thing I've used, and it gets a ton of "this is stupid" and "it's legacy crap" comments online bc it's not a full-featured framework
