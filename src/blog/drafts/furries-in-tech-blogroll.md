With Twitter now in the same tailspin that Facebook has been in for years, and an ever increasing recognition that maybe monolithic profit-driven companies _don't_ have your best interests at heart, [2023 has already been hailed as the year of the personal website](https://matthiasott.com/notes/the-year-of-the-personal-website)—the year we decentralise, democratise, and take back control of our thoughts, rather than outsourcing them to a third-party with a maximum shelf life of 15 years.

I would also like to think of 2023 as being the year that whatever furry stigma still exists in the tech industry finally goes away. [We run the internet](https://thespinoff.co.nz/irl/11-01-2022/who-runs-the-internet-furries), after all. [We decide whether the metaverse lives or dies.] And yet many furries in the technology industry still feel the need to be coy, if not outright secretive, about their anthropomorphic interests.

So, to try and combat some of that stigma and to promote furries actually having their own websites and writing about their work, here's some starters for ten.

I've opted to specifically only cover furries in technology jobs, as that's the industry that I work in myself and am most familiar with.

There are many more furries in other STEM fields from [vaccine research](https://www.inputmag.com/features/furry-scientist-vaccines-chise-covid-19-twitter-controversy) to [hardware development](https://uk.pcmag.com/migrated-99802-smartwatches/140731/your-smartwatchs-heart-rate-monitor-was-developed-by-a-furry). They're all awesome too.

[^1]: I realise that for a lot of people a job is a job, and not something they actually want to talk or write about in their own time. Fair enough! You do you. That's not really the point of this list, though.
