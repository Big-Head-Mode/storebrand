People are generally untrustworthy of corporations nowadays. That's not only fair, it's often entirely justified. Oil companies lied for decades about climate change. Facebook has probably influenced elections. Elon Musk still exists.

But I've found that this distrust has also led to some folks in my circles getting a little... conspiratorial about things. That might be a strong word, we're not talking raging QAnon supporters or flat-earther level stuff. There's just a persistent _vibe_ that if a company has done something they perceive as bad, there must be some grand ulterior motive behind doing it.

Some examples:

- Apple removing the headphone port was to sell more headphones.
- Smartphones no longer having replaceable batteries is planned obsolescence.
- Modern websites are 'flat' and 'bland' because they want to [...]

There may be some truth to these claims, but just as Occam's Razor would imply, the real reasons are often far simpler.
