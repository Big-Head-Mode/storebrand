In 1977, NASA launched the _Voyager 1_ and _Voyager 2_ space probes. Their mission: to fly by Jupiter and Saturn, taking humanity's first intimate photographs and readings of the two largest planets in the Solar System. _Voyager 2_, actually the first to be launched, would go on to take further pictures of Uranus and Neptune, whilst _Voyager 1_ was tasked with getting up close and personal with Titan, one of Saturn's moons.

Well before the missions launched, NASA knew that each probe's trajectories would see them ejected from the Solar System, becoming the first manmade objects to enter interstellar space. _Voyager 1_ did in 2012, and _Voyager 2_ in 2018.

With this foreknowledge came an opportunity. If intelligent life exists out in the universe, then the _Voyager_ probes might be the first piece of the human race they ever encounter, and it's important to make a good first impression.

## The Golden Record

A team led by Carl Sagan decided to produce two records. They were manufactured with gold-plated copper instead of vinyl, to better withstand the millennia of interstellar radiation they would be travelling through. They would come with playback instructions, expressed not in words, but in pictographs and binary. A needle to play the record with was included, already set at the start point of the record.

The record contains both images and audio recordings depending on how it's

It opens with a message from then-Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kurt Waldheim.

The rest of the record is split into three parts, unofficially named " Greetings to the Universe", "Sounds of Earth",

, followed by greetings expressed in 55 different languages, including Ancient Greek, Latin, Sumerian and Welsh.

This is followed by the sounds of Earth, presented in roughly chronological order. It begins with the sounds of thunder, mud pools, birds and whales. Humanity is introduced by footsteps, a heartbeat and laughter. The sounds of tools, a blacksmith, a tractor, ships, trains, and cars come in rapid succession until we reach sounds contemporary to the records: fighter jets and rocket launches. The section briefly returns to humanity—a kiss, a crying child being comforted by a mother—before once again looking to space with the simulated audio of a pulsar.
