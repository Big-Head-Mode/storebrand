I use my computer to actually do stuff, which is why I use Macs. HAHA INFLAMMATORY COMMENT.

Here are some teeny, tiny utility apps I've found very useful when it comes to being productive. Most of them do one thing, and they do it well, [as it should well be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well).

Not endorsed, not affiliate links, I've put them here because I actually use them every day, etc.

## 1) MeetingBar

Do you have meetings? If you're anything like me, you have a lot of them, sometimes too many to remember. [MeetingBar](https://meetingbar.leits.me/) takes away some of the stress of remembering when a meeting is by... telling you when your next meeting is in the menu bar. It can also pop up a notification for you when a meeting is about to begin, and if your meeting is taking place on Zoom, Microsoft Teams or Google Meet, all it takes is one click to join it.

It's shockingly powerful and configurable for a completely free app, with integration support for [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) (in addition to Apple Calendar) and the ability to run custom AppleScripts when you join a meeting. It's saved my bacon more times than I can count.

## 2) Amphetamine

Does your Mac need to stay awake? You could give it some [caffeine](https://ss64.com/osx/caffeinate.html), but if you _really_ want to keep it up you're going to need something a little more powerful.

[Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/amphetamine/id937984704) is caffeine on steroids (am I making any sense here?) Keep your Mac awake for 20 minutes, keep it awake until 8:42pm, keep it awake for as long as an app is running, keep it awake until files have finished downloading, or you can even create custom conditionsâ€”such as staying awake if it's connected to your home wifi.

Like MeetingBar, Amphetamine is completely free and incredibly configurable. It's not terribly often I actually need to use Amphetamine, but when I need it, it's there for me.

## 3) AirBuddy

## 6) Hidden Bar

Now that we've gone and stuck five new icons in your menu bar, let's work on getting rid of them. [Hidden Bar](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066) is... pretty much that. It hides menu bar icons, either permanently, or behind a little arrow so you can reveal them when you need them.

If that sounds like exactly what [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) does, that's because it is; except Bartender costs money, Hidden Bar is free and open source.

The UI is less intuitive and there are fewer features overall, but if you just need to hide some icons and don't need the advanced features Bartender has to offer, Hidden Bar does the job admirably.

## 7) Flotato

## 9 & 10) Alfred & Raycast

Haha, I'm cheating.

I've been an [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) loyalist for many, many years, and it's served me handsomely in that time.

I've recently started trying out [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), which does many of the same things as Alfred, just a little differently.
