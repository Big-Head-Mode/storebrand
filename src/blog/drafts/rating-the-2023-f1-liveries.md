- Wait, what?
- Why would I, someone who has no interest in automobiles and no interest in sport, be interested in motorsport? Yeah, I dunno either. Blame my partner.
- 2023 has seen the introduction of a lot of dark coloured cars for weight-saving reasons. Carbon fibre is free, innit.
- Put these in an order (least favourite to most?) maybe.

## Red Bull

- Same one they've used for like a decade now.
- Was nicer when it didn't say Oracle on the side.
- Arguably a modern classic, too iconic to change?

## Ferrari

- Definitely too iconic to change.
- At least it doesn't have weird green and yellow bits slapped on it this year.

## Mercedes

- They went black and now they can't go back.
- It's pretty neat.
- The use of neon green and neon yellow is a weird choice (esp. as the colours purple and blue are pretty attached to their drivers)

## Alpine

- The pink isn't horrible.
- Still not as nice as the 2021 iteration.

## McLaren

- Too many adverts.
- Really just evolving in the wrong direction. 2021 was much nicer.

## Alfa Romeo

- I dig it.
- I maybe preferred the big _biscione_ from 2021, but this is different in a good way.

## Aston Martin

- It is green.
- Maybe the classiest livery on the grid this year. Also has maybe the least obvious black spots.

## Haas

- Feels like an evolution of the 2021 car more than 2022.
- Like the way they highlight the edges of the sidepods.

## AlphaTauri

- Ehhhh. It's not great. It's not terrible.
- Dark blue and white was pretty classy (and fashionable).
- The red feels a bit slapped on, could've been more artfully applied.
- The hint of orange from one sponsor annoys me.

## Williams

- It is blue. Feels classier than some previous years. Reminds me of the 2021 Alpine.
- Like they continued the Duracell sponsor integration from 2022.
