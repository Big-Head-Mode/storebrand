- I like fonts.
- I cannot decide what font to use on this website.
- I really like the look of Space Mono/Grotesk.
- I don't like how mismatched they are, feature wise.
- Grotesk doesn't even have real italics!
- They feel harder to read compared to more neutral fonts.
- But they feel so _me_.
- In the middle of a battle between preference and practicality.
