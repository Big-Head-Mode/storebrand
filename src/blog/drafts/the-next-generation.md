In the furry fandom, [fursonas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fursona) are many things to many people. They're a real "ask 10 people, get 11 answers" thing. For some their fursona is nothing more than an anthropomorphic animal avatar of themselves, no different from their real life identity outside of physical form. For others, a fursona might be an idealised version of their real world self. The fursona may simply be a character, a puppet to be played with, with a personality and background entirely independent of the person playing them.

Personally, I feel I straddle all three of these categories. My fursonas have have their own names, backstories and lives. I sometimes treat them as their own beings when I write or produce art about them—but they are also reflections of me, their personalities intrinsically linked to the person I was during the time that I created them.

This state of connected–disconnectedness is a hard thing to juggle. My fursonas act like snapshots in time, being their own independent people whilst simultaneously, fleetingly, having to be me. They remain static, whilst I do not.

## We have to talk about Emy

Emy is a bat. My fursona since 2017.

For the first couple of years she was a biological, glasses-wearing Honduran white bat. She was the first fursona I made after returning from my years-long hiatus from the furry fandom, and my first after publicly [coming out as transgender]({{ '/blog/2015-03-13-transition/' | url }}).

Honestly, she didn't get much characterisation. For a while, her biggest quick was that she rarely opened her eyes for... reasons. A bit later on, she played ukulele and started wearing a poncho. During this time she was very much the "me, but a bat" kind of fursona with very little independence from her creator.

Then she became a robot.

{% responsiveImage "./src/images/emy-by-integration.png", "A warmly lit room. The sun is setting outside of the window. Emy, a white, green and black, anthropomorphic robot bat, sits at a workbench. One wing has been detached and is laying in parts on the bench, whilst it uses the other to repair the parts of the disassembled wing." %}

This change was initially intended to be temporary, but it ended up sticking. During this time Emy took on a new life of sorts. Finally, she came into her own as a character, with a backstory and relationships.

A robot bat was just far a more compelling entity to represent myself as. A robot was fitting for someone so cold, logical, and detached. It felt much more 'me'. Nearly a year ago, I concluded that, [in many ways, it was me]({{ '/blog/2022-07-27-discovery/' | url }}).

And for a while, all was good.

Many furries will use the same fursonas for extremely long periods—if they ever meaningfully modify them at all—adapting their fursonas to real-world changes or to maintain the idealised version that they aimed for.

Call it excessively sentimental, but these are beings that I created, named, gave life and history to. It feels kind of wrong to rewrite or erase that person because I no longer relate to them like I once did. So I don't. If my fursona doesn't feel like my fursona anymore, I make a new one, and let the old one live on in perpituity.

## Ashes to Ashes
