At the start of 2023, I committed myself to a theme. Two themes, in fact: to write more and to strengthen my relationships with others. Thus, the Year of Writing & Reconnection was born.

It didn't end up actually lasting a whole year, ending in October and having largely served its purpose.

But afterwards, I spent the following few months umming and aahing over what would come next. A theme needs to fit your medium-to-long term goals, without being too controlling about the minutiae of the goals themselves. Coming up with a 'good one' can be rather difficult.

I pondered something to do with exercising more (I am admittedly very sedentary) but that felt too confining. I considered generalising it into something health-related, but that also felt too limited. Lots of things would be at the prerogative of doctors and clinics, rather than being things I really had much control over.

I've been self-consciously lax about side projects. Many of which have been sitting, waiting for time and updates for months now. (Remember that accessibility guidance I said I'd be writing back in 2022? Hah, yeah...)

I've also just got lots of little things here and there that I really should get done and just haven't for one reason or another.

What kind of theme might encompass all of these disparate things?

## Welcome, to the Year of Getting My Shit In Order.

Or, y'know, the Year of Order, for short.

I think this theme softly encompasses what I want to do this year. In short, establish ways of keeping track of what I want to do, and establishing processes so that _I actually do them in a timely manner_.

Updates on this theme will probably be shorter and scratchier than they were for last year's theme. My goal is to keep on top of things, after all, not go into that much detail about what or how... unless I feel like it, anyway.

## Problems pulverised

- I created a [Workplace Adjustment Passport](https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/tag/workplace-adjustment-passport/) so that we can organise accommodations for the civil service office mandate, which I am dreading horribly.
- I've finally booked an eye test after putting it off for some years. (To be fair, it was originally due to happen mid-covid lockdown.)
- I noticed that I had different NHS numbers on different paperwork. I dropped a few lines and found out what the deal was with that and which one I should be using in future.
- I resumed efforts to work on the new BristolFurs website with gusto. I'm intending to try and get it into a launchable state before moving on to something else.
- It's been some time since the flat last had a deep clean. It's not finished, but I've done a lot more scrubbing this month than I otherwise would.

## Processes pondered

- I've started keeping a todo list at work. So far I've been trying to keep track of things just by memory, and I doubt that's gonna be sustainable.
- The todo list I have for personal stuff is... not well maintained. I should probably work on that.
- I've started keeping track of stuff I want to do with this website on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/querkmachine/beeps.website/issues), also instead of just trying to remember it all.
