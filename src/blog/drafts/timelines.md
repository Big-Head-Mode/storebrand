Today, I went to a pharmacy and picked up some prescription medication.

Not really a notable thing in itself, except that this medication was estrogen, prescribed for the purpose of physical feminisation.

This... has taken a while. Let's see how we got here.

## Timeline

2012 to 2013-ish: Does a little of the ol' gender exploration, briefly identifying as agender and using any pronouns. At this time I was already using a name different to what I was given at birth: Grey.

March 2014: Start identifying as a woman within close friend circles. Begin going by the name Kimberly and using she/her pronouns in those circles.

June 2014: First attempt to get a referral to an NHS gender identity clinic (GIC).

July 2014: Came out as a transgender womanit. Wear women's clothing outside for the first time. Gets harrassed basically immediately.

August 2014: Came out to family members. Things start well, then go less well.

March 2015: Came out to work colleagues.

August 2015: Changed legal name to Kimberly Grey.

August 2016: Ask my new GP if there's been any news from the GIC. Learn that the previous GP had done things incorrectly and not referred me to a GIC at all. Second attempt to get a referral to an NHS GIC.

October 2016: Receive confirmation of my referral to the West of England Gender Identity Clinic.

December 2020: Having not heard anything for _four years_ (the original estimate was 18 months), I get in contact with a private gender clinic.

January 2021: Following a short assessment, I am diagnosed with "gender inconguence" by a private doctor. I begin steps to acquire hormone replacement therapy (HRT) via a private endocrinologst, but administrative complications happen and my anxiety causes me to abandon trying.

April 2022: I begin self medicating HRT, with hormones and anti-androgens purchased from foreign pharmacies.

July 2022: I undergo [a bit of an identity crisis]({{ '/blog/2022-07-27-discovery/' | url }}), starting to identify as alterhuman, changing my public facing name to beeps, returning to identifying as agender, and begin using it/its pronouns.

August 2022: After years without any form of ID, I finally get a passport issued with my new name and an updated gender marker.

December 2023: Finally receive contact from the GIC to organise my first appointment.

February 2024: First appointment. This is a clinical assessment that asked basic questions about my background & my physical and mental health.

July to September 2024: Have a total of six appointments with a psychiatrist doing a deep dive into my history of gender identity, sexuality, relationships, upbringing, relationships and mental wellbeing.
