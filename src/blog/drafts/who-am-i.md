Wake up honey, it's time for your biennial identity crisis.

So, I haven't made much of a secret of considering myself plural. It's [got a whole page in the about section of this site]({{ '/about/olive/' | url }}) and I wrote about [the initial revelation]({{ '/blog/2022-10-27-beeps-in-the-multiverse-of-multiplicity/' | url }}) back when it was fresh.

For the newbies, plurality (or [multiplicity](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicity_(subculture)>) is the existence of distinct individuals sharing a body. They may exist in harmony or in conflict; they may share memories and personality traits or be entirely estranged from one another; one may control the 'front' at a time or many share the position at once.

This post is not about plurality, it's about **mental shifts**.

Mental shifts are, in some senses, like plurality. They involve significant, usually uncontrolled shifts in one's style of thinking and self-perception, but without the separation of individuals.

You're the same person, just... changed for a while.
