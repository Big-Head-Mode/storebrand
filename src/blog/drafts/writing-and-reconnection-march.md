## Year of Writing

- Lots of stuff at work has been writing-related, so not so much happened.
- Drafted _some_ blogs.
- Made good progress on fiction for the first time in a good while.

## Year of Reconnection

- It feels like I'll have to employ one of the features of Yearly Themes and tweak the meaning.
- Started getting involved in new social circles and communities.
- 'Reconnecting' in a different way.
