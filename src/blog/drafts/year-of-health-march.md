Things are still a bit of a mess.

## Diet

Pretty much still by the wayside as I deal with other stuff. The only thing I can claim victory here on is that I'm eating more vegetables than probably any other point in my adult life.

## Exercise

Biking also hasn't happened at all. I've upped the amount of walking I do to try and compensate a little, but as a more time-consuming and less-intensive form of exercise, it doesn't feel like a wholly adequate substitute.

## Mental health

Still not amazing.

## Medical

I officially have a diagnosis of asthma now. The neat thing is that it doesn't seem _terribly_ bad asthma, being fairly situational and avoidable with lifestyle choices (e.g. not running around like a loon). I've got a maintenace inhaler that I'll probably be using for the rest of my life, but that's about it.

I've been put back on blood pressure medication, as my measurements began climbing again a short while after stopping. I'm also getting referred to a hypertension clinic for it.

In better news, last month's scare about kidney function issues seemed like a false flag triggered by the food poisoning. Follow up tests had function back to normal, but they're still planning to ultrasound my kidneys to see if there's an issue with blood flow to them, which could be a contributing factor to the high blood pressure.

I have dates for my sleep apnea study too, which is happening in May.

So, drumroll for the list please, ü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Å. I'm waiting for:

- an appointment with the hypertension clinic.
- an ultrasound to check on my kidneys.
- a check-in with the gender clinic.
- a referral to a speech therapist.
- a referral for laser hair removal.
- sleep study dates.

The dermatologist referral has dropped off the list for now, at my request to my GP. I'm dealing with enough medical stuff as it is, and that one is minor enough that I'd rather deal with it later rather than keep it in the mix.
