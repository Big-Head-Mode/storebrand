In 2012, Dan Cathy, the then-COO of the American fast-food chain Chick-fil-A made several public statements opposing same-sex marriage, claiming that those who were "arrogant" enough to support same-sex marriage were "inviting God's judgment" and that the chain was only successful due to supporting "the biblical definition of the family unit".

This came soon after it had been revealed that Chick-fil-A had donated $5 million in corporate profits to anti-LGBTQ groups in the preceding nine years, most of it in 2009 and 2010.

Chick-fil-A rapidly released a statement that the restaurant did not concern itself with the politics of same-sex marriage. Despite this, and the controversy that followed Cathy's comments, the restaurant continued financially supporting anti-LGBTQ causes.

Cathy, for his trouble, was promoted to CEO the following year.

Unsurprisingly, a large-scale boycott of the company started following Cathy's comments, including politicians at all levels, protests outside of restaurant locations, the cancellation of corporate partnerships, blacklisting from federal government facilities, and the revocation of permission to open new franchises.

This boycott persisted for years, even [contributing to the closure of the restaurant's first UK location only eight days after it opened](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/chick-fil-a-close-first-uk-restaurant-reading-lgtb-backlash-a9162491.html) in 2019.

In 2020, Chick-fil-A finally stopped funding anti-LGBTQ organisations.

The boycott, seemingly, had worked. Chick-fil-A hadn't suffered financially, it hadn't stopped expanding in those intervening years, but the cultural zeitgeist of it being a homophobic chicken restaurant stuck with it unrelentingly.

After all, why eat at a homophobic chicken restaurant when you could just... not?

Earlier this month, the video game _Hogwarts Legacy_ was released, the latest piece of the once-unimaginably popular, [now-somewhat ailing](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/08/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-cancel-them-how-the-wizarding-world-lost-its-magic) "Wizarding World" series.

It's impossible today, however, to separate that series from its creator, J. K. Rowling.

In the UK, Rowling has inserted herself as a central figure in the movement opposed to the rights of transgender people. Over time, she's come to rub shoulders with notorious homophobes, anti-LGBTQ groups, and the alt-right, often singing from their same hymn sheet.

At the same time, the works that originally made her famous have come under greater scrutiny for their regressive ideals. Looking back at them with an adult eye raises a lot of eyebrows: A caste of slaves who love being slaves; a species of antisemitic stereotypes who control the wizarding world's banking sector; the only named Indian, east Asian and Irish characters all being terrible cultural stereotypes; and, oh yeah, the main villain is apparently evil because he's the result of magical rape?

Months before _Hogwarts Legacy_ released, LGBTQ and Jewish groups were already organising for boycotts of the game.

Rowling's response to this has been simple: She doesn't care. So long as people continue to consume the Wizarding World, she makes money. So long as she makes money, she is going to spend it supporting anti-LGBTQ organisations.

So why are so many people, including people who are LGBTQ, seemingly intent to play it when they could just... not?

Common arguments:

- JK Rowling didn't make the game — no, but it's her problematic universe, and the lead designer for most of the development also turned out to be a huge bigot
- I'm supporting the devs — the devs already got paid, the only folks who get royalties from purchases are people like rowling
- It doesn't matter because the game is already successful — collective action only works because lots of individuals participate in it, one person boycotting is still more effective than them not
- It doesn't matter because 'there's no ethical consumption under capitalism' — that argument is for shit like food and shelter, not video games
- It's fine, it has a trans character — by word of god, the character in the game says nothing to that effect
- I'm gonna pirate it — even if you're not financially supporting the game, you're giving it cultural capital and making it seem acceptable for others to purchase and play it
