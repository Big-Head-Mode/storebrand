I'm a Bristol-based [frontend developer]({{ '/about/work/' | url }}) specialising in accessibility, design systems, and the semantic web. I currently work at the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) on the [GOV.UK Design System](http://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

I'm [alterhuman]({{ '/about/nonhuman/' | url }}), [agender]({{ '/about/gender/' | url }}), [asexual]({{ '/about/asexuality/' | url }}), and [a shapeshifting critter on the internet]({{ '/about/furry/' | url }}) to boot. I use it/its pronouns. It's all a bit complicated.

This is my personal website where I kinda just put whatever. It's not like you can stop me.
