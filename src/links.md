I am remiss that [websites these days don't just link to cool things anymore]({{ '/blog/2023-11-27-buttons/' | url }}). Of course, when I wrote that article, this website didn't do that either, so let's right that wrong.

Here's some lesser known neat webbed sites I like.

Last updated: {{ updated | formatDate('human') }}

## Blogroll

[Adam Silver](https://adamsilver.io/) quite literally wrote [the book on form design](https://formdesignpatterns.com/) and his blog is one of the first places I tend to look when wondering how best to word or layout a question.

[Adrian Roselli](https://adrianroselli.com/) is a specialist in web accessibility, unafraid of doing deep dives into the nitty-gritty and loudly calling out the failures of major corporations alike. Truly an inspiration.

[Dhole Moments](https://soatok.blog/) mostly writes about cryptography, technology, the furry fandom, and all the ways those things frequently intersect.

[Food is Stupid](https://foodisstupid.substack.com/). This blog is cursed. This food is cursed. None of you are without sin. (Annoyingly half the posts are behind a paywall, but the rest of them are still good.)

[TrekMovie.com](https://trekmovie.com/), despite the name, covers all the media relating to the world of _Star Trek_. This is important to me because I'm a huge dork.

[Xe Iaso](https://xeiaso.net/) writes about all sorts of software things that I barely understand but find interesting anyway. Also where I stole the idea of having character callouts from.

## Neat, niche YouTube channels

[Auto Schenanigans](https://www.youtube.com/@AutoShenanigans) has a bloke drive around the UK and sardonically tell you things about roads and petrol. He's kinda like one of those train YouTubers but for motorways.

[Chain Bear](https://www.youtube.com/@chainbear) makes video essays about Formula 1 and motorsport, usually to explain some piece of technology or weird application of the rules. They're pretty calming, and proved quite useful

[FUNKe](https://www.youtube.com/@FUNKe) makes cool, animated video essays about video games (and somehow the band Weezer without ever actually making a video _about_ Weezer). I can't say I play games (or Weezer) enough to really get it, but the presentation style is da bomb y'all.

[The Infinite Review](https://www.youtube.com/@TheInfiniteReview) seeks to make a review about everything in the universe ever. It might take a while.

[Jago Hazzard](https://www.youtube.com/@JagoHazzard) has a bloke train around London and sardonically tell you things about railway lines and rolling stock. He's kinda like one of those car YouTubers but for the London Underground.

[Junkball](https://www.youtube.com/@JunkBallMedia) makes video essays about stupid things in _Star Trek_ and if that doesn't sell you then I've got nothin'.

[Linus Boman](https://www.youtube.com/@LinusBoman) makes videos about design and typography, ranging from history lessons to conceptual redesigns. Videos don't come often, but they're always exceptionally well produced and presented.

[Marcel Vos](https://www.youtube.com/@MarcelVos) explains and breaks the RollerCoaster Tycoon games of my youth.

[Noodle](https://www.youtube.com/@noodlefunny), like FUNKe, makes hella enjoyable animated video essays about video games (and sometimes other things).

[Planet Clue](https://www.youtube.com/@planetclue) makes deep dive essays into technology and game franchises from the 90s and 2000s.

## Web development tools

[Accessible Brand Colors](https://abc.useallfive.com/) lets you ensure that your colour contrast is <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> compliant. What makes it special? Well, it lets you do your entire colour palette at once, not just two.

[Modularscale](https://www.modularscale.com/) is a tool to generate header hierarchies that follow predictable increases or decreases in size relative to other text. It's a minor thing, but it's hella useful.

[WhoCanUse](https://www.whocanuse.com/) doesn't just let you ensure your colour contrast is accessible, but simultaneously simulates how it looks in a bunch of vision-related and environmental conditions.

## Other places

[The Cutting Room Floor](https://tcrf.net/) documents all the parts of video games that made it into the files but didn't make it into the final game. It's a fascinating insight into how popular games were developed and refined.

_[Meet Me In The Woods](https://mmitwcomic.tumblr.com/post/699016339886637056/cover-and-a-little-dedicatory-pagebecause-im-a)_ is a sci-fi mystery webcomic. It's also indirectly the source material for [my fursona]({{ '/about/furry/' | url }}). I'm totally not biased.

[StarTrek.website](https://startrek.website/) is a website for discussing _Star Trek_, both in the incredibly serious and ludicrously unserious ways. I just lurk there rather than posting, but it's a fun joint.

[The 88x31 GIF Collection](https://cyber.dabamos.de/88x31/) hoards all of those cool linky buttons the websites of yesteryear used to have.
