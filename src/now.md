A "now" page is [a conceptual accompaniment to an about page](https://nownownow.com/about). While an about page can tell you about my background and my identity, it doesn't tell you about what I'm currently doing or what I currently care about. Thus, this.

## Now

❄️ The cold and dark of an approaching winter has probably suppressed my mood a bit. I'm generally finding myself to be more exhausted and less sociable than I'd like.

🧑‍💻 I'm working as a frontend developer on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) team, currently working on some things I can't talk about publicly yet. I'm also helping with updates to the [WCAG Primer](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/).

🎨 I've had a heavy itch to redesign this website a bit—and have redesigned the homepage slightly—but am struggling to figure out how best to achieve what I'm after.

🎶 Lately, I've been jamming out to [_SMILE! :D_](https://album.link/i/1740856393) by Porter Robinson, [_The Last Flight_](https://album.link/i/1748134573) by Public Service Broadcasting, and [_Symphony of Lungs_](https://album.link/i/1774374954) by Florence + the Machine and the BBC Symphony Orchestra.

📺 I'm watching the current series of _Only Connect_ and _The Great British Bake Off_ (I'm was backing Sumayah, heck). I'm also rewatching _Star Trek: Enterprise_ alongside [_The Greatest Generation_ podcast](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/greatest-generation/).

🎮 I've been playing far too much [TCG Card Shop Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3070070/TCG_Card_Shop_Simulator/) (shush you) and [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/).

## Recently

🧑‍💻 At work, I led development and release of Charles III's updated royal coat of arms and the new [Service Navigation component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/service-navigation/), and helped do some accessibility investigations around the Design System website.

✍️ After a bit of a lull in the middle of the year, I've started putting more effort into writing blog posts again. I've also been making a fair few improvements to the underlying bits of this site, including porting everything to [Eleventy 3 and ESM]({{ '/blog/2024-10-02-the-changelog-eleventy-3-forced-colours-new-art/' | url }}).

🥚 I also implemented a stupid easter egg zhat you'll have to find.

## Soon

⚡ I'd quite like to rework some behind the scenes stuff on this here website in the near future. I'd quite like to make it so that pages only load the CSS for components they actually use, as there's quite a lot of components in the code by now, some of them only on single pages.

💭 I'm looking to improve my ability to actually explain my thought process when I do things, via the mediums of blogging and mentoring. This is probably easier said than done. [My brain isn't exactly a neurotypical place.]({{ '/about/neurodivergent/' | url }})

🏖️ Taylor and I are sorting out arrangements to attend [NordicFuzzCon](https://nordicfuzzcon.org/) in Malmö, Sweden in February; and we'll also be attending [ConFuzzled](https://confuzzled.org.uk/) in May. Two conventions in one year! Fancy!

📺 I'm looking forward to [_Severance_ season two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP6M9zS_pQ) (finally!)
