A "now" page is [a conceptual accompaniment to an about page](https://nownownow.com/about). While an about page can tell you about my background and my identity, it doesn't tell you about what I'm currently doing or what I currently care about. Thus, this.

## Now

❄️ The cold and dark of an approaching winter has probably suppressed my mood a bit. I'm generally finding myself to be more exhausted and less sociable than I'd like.

🧑‍💻 I'm working as a frontend developer on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) team, currently working on some things I can't talk about publicly yet. I'm also helping with updates to the [WCAG Primer](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/).

🎨 I've had a heavy itch to redesign this website a bit—and have redesigned the homepage slightly—but am struggling to figure out how best to achieve what I'm after.

🎶 Lately, I've been jamming out to [_Hyperdrama_](https://album.link/i/1724935208) by Justice, [_The Last Flight_](https://album.link/i/1748134573) by Public Service Broadcasting, and [_I Made An Album_](https://album.link/i/1686402099) by Daði Freyr.

🖖 I'm rewatching _Star Trek: Enterprise_ alongside [_The Greatest Generation_ podcast](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/greatest-generation/), _Star Trek: Lower Decks_ alongside [_Greatest Trek_](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/greatest-trek). I've also been watching _Only Connect_ and _Formula 1_, whenever those are on.

🎮 I've been playing [_Two Point Hospital_](https://www.twopointstudios.com/en/games/two-point-hospital) and [_Two Point Campus_](https://www.twopointstudios.com/en/games/two-point-campus). Deux points.

## Recently

🧑‍💻 At work, I led development and release of Charles III's updated royal coat of arms and the new [Service Navigation component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/service-navigation/), and helped do some accessibility investigations around the Design System website.

🕸️ After a bit of a lull in the middle of the year, I've started putting more effort into writing blog posts again. I've also been making a fair few improvements to the underlying bits of this site, including porting everything to [Eleventy 3 and ESM]({{ '/blog/2024-10-02-the-changelog-eleventy-3-forced-colours-new-art/' | url }}), rewriting how external images are handled, and component-ising all of the CSS files.

🥚 I also implemented a stupid easter egg zhat you'll just have to find.

## Soon

🎅 Christmas, obviously. A bit of a break outta be nice.

💭 I'm looking to improve my ability to actually explain my thought process when I do things, via the mediums of blogging and mentoring. This is probably easier said than done. [My brain isn't exactly a neurotypical place.]({{ '/about/neurodivergent/' | url }})

🏖️ Taylor and I are sorting out arrangements to attend [NordicFuzzCon](https://nordicfuzzcon.org/) in Malmö, Sweden in February; and we'll also be attending [ConFuzzled](https://confuzzled.org.uk/) in May. Two conventions in one year! Fancy!
