A "now" page is [a conceptual accompaniment to an about page](https://nownownow.com/about). While an about page can tell you about my background and my identity, it doesn't tell you about what I'm currently doing or what I currently care about. Thus, this.

## Now

🥦 I've started a new diet and exercise regime as part of the [Year of Health]({{ '/blog/2025-01-01-the-year-of-health/' | url }}). So far it's... not been fun.

🧑‍💻 I'm working as a frontend developer on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) team, currently working on some long-term things I can't talk about publicly yet. I'm also helping with updates to the [WCAG Primer](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/).

🎨 I've started [giving this website a fresh lick of paint]({{ '/blog/2025-01-11-renovating-in-the-open/' | url }}).

🎶 Lately, I've been on a musical theatre kick and been relistening to the soundtracks to [Matilda](https://album.link/gb/i/471417216) and [Hamilton](https://album.link/gb/i/1025210938).

🖖 I'm currently watching the latest series of _What We Do in the Shadows_, _Guy Montgomery's Guy Mont Spelling Bee_, _Jet Lag: The Game_, and rewatching _Star Trek: Enterprise_ alongside [_The Greatest Generation_ podcast](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/greatest-generation/),

🎮 I got lost in the _Factorio_ rabbit hole again over Christmas and finally conquered Gleba. Finally.

## Recently

🎅 Christmas, obviously. Some time off work was nice, though I didn't get to see as many people as I'd like.

## Soon

🐾 [NordicFuzzCon](https://nordicfuzzcon.org/) in Malmö, Sweden in February and [ConFuzzled](https://confuzzled.org.uk/) in Birmingham in May. Two conventions in one year! Fancy!

🚄 I'd like to travel a bit more this year. Probably take some long weekends in other parts of the country.

📺 _Severence_ season two. 👀
