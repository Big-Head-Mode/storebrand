  description: A basic overview of what I'm up to at the moment.

A "now" page is [a conceptual accompaniment to an about page](https://nownownow.com/about). While an about page can tell you about my background and my identity, it doesn't tell you about what I'm currently doing or what I currently care about. Thus, this.

## Now

💻 I'm working as a frontend developer on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) team, currently working on some long-term things I can't talk about publicly yet. I'm also assisting with updates to the [WCAG Primer](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/).

🏥 Unfortunately, I'm dealing with a lot of health-related probing at the moment, with stacks of overlapping doctor and hospital appointments for all manner of maladies.

🧠 As a result, my mental health isn't really doing the best right now.

🎶 Lately, [I've been listening](https://www.last.fm/user/robomilk/library) to my whole library on shuffle, rediscovering music I've not listened to for a while.

📺 [I'm watching](https://trakt.tv/users/batbeeps/history) _Severance_ (I **love** _Severance_), _Invincible_, and _Mythic Quest_; alongside my _Star Trek: Enterprise_ rewatch to accompany the [_The Greatest Generation_ podcast](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/greatest-generation/).

🎮 I've been playing a fair amount of _The Sims_ (of all generations) given it's the franchise's 25th anniversary. And I got lost in the _Factorio_ rabbit hole again.

## Recently

🇸🇪 I went to Sweden to attend NordicFuzzCon (a furry convention). It was really cool, in more ways than one, and I got to meet a lotta folks that I'd previously only interacted with online—one after nearly two decades!

❤️‍🩹 I have been really quite ill a lot lately. In February alone, I was hospitalised with a combined asthma attack and respiratory tract infection, and a few weeks later, I got severe food poisoning.
