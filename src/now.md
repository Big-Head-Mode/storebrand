A "now" page is [a conceptual accompaniment to an about page](https://nownownow.com/about). While an about page can tell you about my background and my identity, it doesn't tell you about what I'm currently doing or what I currently care about. Thus, this.

## Now

I'm working as a frontend developer on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) team, currently working on things I can't talk about yet. I'm also assisting with updates to the [WCAG Primer](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/).

I'm taking a bit of a break from traveling, having recently made multiple business and leisure trips to London, Exeter and Liverpool in the last couple of months.

Lately, I've been jamming out to [_SMILE! :D_](https://album.link/gb/i/1740856393) by Porter Robinson and [_The Last Flight_](https://album.link/i/1748134573) by Public Service Broadcasting.

I'm watching the current series of _Only Connect_ and _The Great British Bake Off_ (I'm backing Sumayah). I'm also rewatching _Star Trek: Enterprise_ alongside [_The Greatest Generation_ podcast](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/greatest-generation/) and playing [TCG Card Shop Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3070070/TCG_Card_Shop_Simulator/) (shush you), whilst waiting for the [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) 2.0 release.

## Recently

At work, I led development and release of Charles III's updated royal coat of arms and the new [service navigation component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/service-navigation/), and helped do some accessibility investigations around the Design System website.

We're most of the way through [The Year of Order]({{ '/blog/yearly-theme/' | url }}), during which I'm trying to get my various shits together. This has most recently manifested as reorganising and stocking up my kitchen.

After a bit of a lull in the middle of the year, I've started putting more effort into writing blog posts again. I've also been making a fair few improvements to the underlying bits of this site, including porting everything to [Eleventy 3 and ESM]({{ '/blog/2024-10-02-the-changelog-eleventy-3-forced-colours-new-art/' | url }}).

## Soon

Taylor and I are paid up for and sorting out arrangements to attend [NordicFuzzCon](https://nordicfuzzcon.org/) in Malm√∂, Sweden in February. We're still pondering whether to attend [ConFuzzled](https://confuzzled.org.uk/) or not.
