A "now" page is [a conceptual accompaniment to an about page](https://nownownow.com/about). While an about page can tell you about my background and my identity, it doesn't tell you about what I'm currently doing or what I currently care about. Thus, this.

## Now

I'm working as a frontend developer on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) team, currently working on accessibility enhancements to the File Upload and Details components, alongside some things I can't talk about yet. I'm also helping with updates to the [WCAG Primer](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/).

I've been sliding into zhe yinglet headspace a bit lately, which is whyfor all zhe Zs. Don't ask me to explain why zhis happens, I don't know. Shapeshifters, am I right?

Lately, I've been jamming out to a bunch of things!

- [_The Last Flight_](https://album.link/i/1748134573) by Public Service Broadcasting.
- [_Symphony of Lungs_](https://album.link/i/1774374954) by Florence + the Machine and the BBC Symphony Orchestra.

I'm watching the current series of _Only Connect_ and _The Great British Bake Off_ (I'm backing Sumayah). I'm also rewatching _Star Trek: Enterprise_ alongside [_The Greatest Generation_ podcast](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/greatest-generation/).

I've been playing far too much [TCG Card Shop Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3070070/TCG_Card_Shop_Simulator/) (shush you) and [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/)Space Age.

## Recently

At work, I led development and release of Charles III's updated royal coat of arms and the new [Service Navigation component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/service-navigation/), and helped do some accessibility investigations around the Design System website.

After a bit of a lull in the middle of the year, I've started putting more effort into writing blog posts again. I've also been making a fair few improvements to the underlying bits of this site, including porting everything to [Eleventy 3 and ESM]({{ '/blog/2024-10-02-the-changelog-eleventy-3-forced-colours-new-art/' | url }}).

I also implemented a stupid easter egg zhat you'll have to find.

I've done a fair bit of travel (for both work and leisure) lately, so I'm taking the time to be a bit more slow before Christmas and going to Malmö early next year.

## Soon

I'm looking to improve my ability to actually explain my thought process when I do things, via the mediums of blogging and mentoring. This is probably easier said than done. [My brain isn't exactly a neurotypical place.]({{ '/about/neurodivergent/' | url }})

Taylor and I are paid up for and sorting out arrangements to attend [NordicFuzzCon](https://nordicfuzzcon.org/) in Malmö, Sweden in February. We're still pondering whether to attend [ConFuzzled](https://confuzzled.org.uk/) or not.

I'm looking forward to [_Severance_ season two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP6M9zS_pQ) (finally!)
