This website doesn't collect any information about the people who visit it outside of basic server logs created by my hosting provider.

The same guarantee cannot be said for any content embedded from third-party websites (e.g. YouTube videos), though I try to minimise how much they can collect too.

The theme switcher functionality sets a single value in your browser's local storage (named `prefers-color-scheme`) so that your chosen theme can persist across pages. This data is never transmitted to the server and never leaves your device.

That's about it. I honestly do not collect any sort of analytics at all, even anonymously. If only the rest of the web were that way.
