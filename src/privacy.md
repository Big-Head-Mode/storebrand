This website doesn't collect any information about the people who visit it outside of basic server logs created by my hosting provider.

The same guarantee cannot be said for any content embedded from third-party websites (e.g. YouTube videos), though I try to minimise how much they can collect too.

That's about it. I honestly do not collect any sort of analytics at all, even anonymously. If only the rest of the web were that way.
